A list of “Critical Raw Materials” was established in 2010 and revised in 2014 (European Commission MEMO/14/377, 26/05/2014). None of the 20 listed raw materials are significantly mined or produced in Europe. 
It has also been recognized that Europe holds valuable mineral resources in both primary and secondary mines. Concerning the primary mines, Europe has been actively mined over many centuries and many easy-to-access mineral deposits are mostly depleted. The major opportunities to access raw materials within the EU are in populated areas, in low grade or small complex deposits that may vary in composition over time and contain different size of particles from coarse to very fine grains. The challenge in the processing of these raw materials lays on the evolution of the existing processing to the European constraints. For the secondary mines, the challenges are various and the task even more complex. Processes must be adapted or even specifically designed for the material or the waste to be treated. Before being industrially developed, these processes need not only to be efficient but also to take into account the economic, environmental and societal aspects in Europe and abroad.  
Therefore, it is necessary for European industry (mining and metals industry, technology providers, recyclers…) to have access to a network of knowledge that can work cross-sectorially and innovatively by combining the expertise of all members. Flexibility and speed will be enhanced and solutions will come into industrial use faster and more efficiently. Future needs and challenges are not known, but the flexibility and versatility of the network and the cooperation between research partners and stakeholders enable industry to respond to these challenges more efficiently.  
PROMETIA is the research and integration network that has been designed to address these challenges.  
The Association aims to strengthen technical skills and industrial know-how in Europe in raw materials processing for supporting the industrial and economic development by: 
•    promoting an easier access of industrial partners to the most relevant and competent European R&D teams as well as to services & facilities for up-scaling metallurgical and mineral processes in Europe, 
•    promoting the most innovative cutting-edge scientific results from the European research teams towards the industrial partners, 
•    facilitating the visibility and the access of all the partners to different funding opportunities.","European","Raw Materials Initiative

MEMBERS AND COVERAGE - Ceemet Members are national employer organisations, almost universally with a legal social partner mandate from metal, engineering and technology-based industries in 22 countries. Ceemet members are responsible for representing the social policy and industrial relations' interests of the metal companies in the country concerned, and, where so existing, for the conclusion of 
the collective agreements in the metal industry. Ceemet has the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) as an associated Member. Ceemet also has contacts with cross-industry employers’ organisations in countries where no 
employer organisation of the metal, engineering and technology-based industries exist and here in particular in the new EU Member 
States, such as SP of the Czech Republic, MGYOSZ of Hungary, PKPP and KPP of Poland. The member organisations of Ceement 
cover -in principle- the entire range of sectors of the manufacturing industries, including  
• Basic Metals  
• Fabricated Metal Goods  
•Mechanical Engineering  
• Electrical and Electronical Industry 
• ICT Industries 
• Medical, precision and optical instruments, watches 
etc.  
• Transportation Means (automobile, ship, aircraft)  
• Instrument Engineering.  
 
Some national member organisations also cover the 
metal producing industries (iron and steel) or parts of it foundries. Altogether, the Ceemet Members represent about 200,000 member companies employing  35 million workers. The objectives as laid down in the statutes of Ceemet are “to promote the exchange of information among its members on all social issues which directly affect interests of these industries. It is also to facilitate 
concerted views and the formulation of statements on matters of common interest. In achieving these purposes the Association may 
make such representation to international organisations as is required."" Ceemet activities and tasks are based on two pillars: - the 
exchange and structural documentation of national information on industrial relations, labour law or training matters in the metal and 
electrical industry - the follow-up of European matters, including lobbying on dossiers of particular interest to our industry. Ceemet 
follows the wide spectrum of social policy affairs via different Groups and Committees which meet regularly and deal with matters on - ""Industrial and Employee Relations"", - ""European Union"" - covering labour law and social protection - ""Education, Training and Employability"" - ""Health and Safety"" and - ""Socio-Economic Trends"". In January 2010 Ceemet and the EMF (European Metalworkers Federation) have set up a sectoral social dialogue committee covering the metal, engineering and technology-based industries - this committee was set up with the approval and recognition of the European Commission. Occasionally, Ceemet activities also address manufacturing specific issues at global level, in particular at ILO and and IOE level. Ceemet nearly entirely 
financed through membership contributions from its national member organisations.","European, global","Ceemet's main focus lies with initiatives in the area of: 
a. labour market surveillance and labour law at national and European level, b. employment and social policy, including social protection, c. education and employability, d. health and safety at the workplace, e. national and European level industrial relations. 
Some recent related initiatives comprise the carrying out of an international Ceemet study on flexible forms of employment in the MET industry (2015), an international study on industrial relations and wage determination in the MET industry (2014), publishing a manifesto on industry EU policy priorities (industrial competitiveness for a social Europe)(2014) and organising a debate on this in the EP as well as the organisation of European Forums for Manufacturing, bringing together MEPs and Commission officials with representatives from national Ceemet members including practitioners from company level. 
Ceemet is the sole authoritative source of information on the current state of labour law in its representative sector, publishing its annual detailed summary of labour and employment law including the latest legal requirements resulting from its members' collective agreements.","Ceemet regularly compiles studies on labour legislation, collective agreements, working conditions etc. based on information from our members. http://www.ceemet.org/page/studies 
 
Ceemet publishes  regular news items on our website - http://www.ceemet.org/news. 
 
Ceemet is the representative social dialogue employer organisation for its sector, conducting studies into the use of various forms of employment contracts jointly with trade unions, publishing the same and conducting both bilateral and mulit-lateral meetings with trade unions on issues of labour law and social policy. 
 
Finally, Ceemet organises a number of events annually to promote policy messages e.g. conferences, seminars, breakfast meetings, evening reception with relevant EU stakeholders.","Ceemet has an active participant in the work of the Employment and social affairs committee. Its representatives have given evidence before the committee, attended groups working in specific policy initiatives, for example the posting of workers, and Health and safety issues, and regularly submits evidence to and meets with the committee members. Ceemet actively supports many individual members of the committee, regardless of any particular political affiliation, with their individual own initiative reports, supplying evidence, facilitating meetings with companies and trade unions, and providing data sets for analysis.",,"N/A",6,5.5,4,"Combûchen Uwe, HARKIN John, REMANS Margue, SOBRINO MATE ISABEL","Institutional affairs, Economy, finance and the euro, Budget, Competition, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Business and Industry, Youth, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Research and innovation","EEN - European Employers Network at BUSINESSEUROPE","Full members: http://www.ceemet.org/members

Die IG Metall ist mit über 2,3 Millionen Mitgliedern die größte Einzelgewerkschaft weltweit. Wir handeln gute und faire Tarifverträge aus und engagieren uns für eine gerechte Gesellschaft in der Arbeits- und Lebenswelt. Gemeinsam mit Mitgliedern, Betriebsräten, Vertrauensleuten und allen Engagierten, setzen wir uns für ein Gutes Leben ein.  
 
Mit mehr als 125 000 Vertrauensleuten und Betriebsräten in über 18 000 Betrieben vertreten wir die wirtschaftlichen, politischen und kulturellen Interessen unserer Mitglieder. Wir setzen uns für die Beschäftigten in den Branchen Metall und Elektro, Eisen und Stahl, Textil und Bekleidung, Informationstechnik, Holz und Kunststoff und in der Zeit- und Leiharbeit ein. Bei uns sind Facharbeiter, Angestellte, Auszubildende, Ingenieure und viele andere Beschäftigte vereint. Über 160 regionale IG Metall Verwaltungsstellen in sieben Bezirken organisieren bundesweit die Gewerkschaftsarbeit. In unserer Zentrale in Frankfurt unterstützen wir die Verwaltungsstellen und koordinieren die politische Arbeit. 
 
Das EU-Verbindungsbüro vertritt seit 2014 die Interessen der IG Metall gegenüber den europäischen Institutionen. Es verfolgt und begleitet aktiv die europäische Gesetzgebung und informiert laufend über europäische Rechtsetzungsvorhaben und -entwicklungen. 
 
Die Tarifpolitik der IG Metall 
Die Tarifpolitik ist eine der wichtigsten Aufgaben der IG Metall. Tarifverträge müssen den Bedürfnissen der Beschäftigten gerecht werden. In den Tarifverhandlungen setzen wir uns dafür ein, Einkommen zu sichern und zu erhöhen, Arbeitszeiten zu verkürzen, die Arbeitsqualität zu steigern und Arbeits- und Ausbildungsplätze zu erhalten. 
 
Vertrauensleute und gewerkschaftliche Betriebspolitik 
Unsere Vertrauensleute und Betriebsräte setzen sich im Betrieb für eine gerechte Einkommensverteilung und gute Arbeitsbedingungen ein. Gesundheitsschutz am Arbeitsplatz, umweltschonende Produktion, Organisation der Arbeit, betriebliche und berufliche Weiterbildung der Beschäftigten, Eingruppierung und Arbeitszeit - das sind die Themen, mit denen sich unsere Vertrauensleute und Betriebsräte auseinandersetzen. Vertrauensleute werden von den IG Metall-Mitgliedern im Betrieb gewählt. Sie beraten unsere Mitglieder über ihre Rechte aus Tarifverträgen und Betriebsvereinbarungen, erörtern Tarifforderungen, informieren über die Politik der IG Metall und nominieren die Kandidaten der IG Metall für den Betriebsrat. 
 
Der Betriebsrat 
Der Betriebsrat wird von allen Beschäftigten gewählt und ist die gesetzliche Interessenvertretung im Betrieb. Seine Rechte und Pflichten regelt das Betriebsverfassungsgesetz. Über 80 Prozent der Betriebsratsmitglieder in der Metallwirtschaft sind in der IG Metall organisiert. Wir wollen die Mitbestimmungsrechte zugunsten der Belegschaft ausweiten. 
 
Die IG Metall in der Gesellschaft 
Wir fordern eine soziale, demokratische und ökologische Wirtschaftsordnung und eine gerechte Gesellschaft in der Arbeits- und Lebenswelt. Gemeinsam mit unseren Mitgliedern gestalten wir die politische Entwicklung mit, um gerechte Arbeits- und Lebensverhältnisse zu erreichen.","European, global, national, regional/local","Regulierung CO2-Grenzwerte bei PKW, Europa 2020, Energy Union, Industrie-, Klima und energiepolitische Initiativen wie zum Beispiel Regulierung CO2-Grenzwerten und Europa 2020","Veranstaltungen zu den Themen CO2-Regulierung und Industriepolitik, Publikation ""Das soziale Europa"" (Link: https://www.otto-brenner-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_data/stiftung/Veranstaltungen/MOE/2014/Themenheft_Europa_final_zweite_Auflage_deutsch_74fa165c3cfacf4bb871ee21c87dc97c72dc2ac3.pdf)",,,"Comité consultatif pour la sécurité et la santé sur le lieu de travail#X01211#TIEDEMANN Moriz-Boje #http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=1211#Alternate Member#B#Other#Enforcement#High Level expert Group on energy-intensive industries#E03326#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3326#Member#C#Sherpa Group",5,4.5,1,"KÜHN Hannes Hauke","Institutional affairs, Economy, finance and the euro, Trade, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Enlargement, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Business and Industry, Environment, Youth, Single market, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Climate Action","Die IG Metall ist Mitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (DGB), der industriAll – European Trade Union und der industriAll Global Union.",,"01/01/2017","01/12/2017",,"300000-399999",0,,,,,,,"Metal"

& Co. Das Markenzeichen Wilesco entstand aus der Bezeichnung Wilhelm 
Schröder & Co. Das als Aluminiumgießerei eröffnete Unternehmen fertigte 
zunächst nur Essbestecke, Abzeichen und Möbelbeschläge. Anfang der 
1920er Jahre wurden dann Puppenbestecke und kleine Töpfchen aus Aluminium 
(sogenanntes hauswirtschaftliches Spielzeug) in das Fertigungsprogramm 
aufgenommen. Diese Entscheidung wirkte sich sehr positiv aus, da 
in der folgenden Weltwirtschaftskrise sehr große Mengen von diesem hauswirtschaftlichen 
Spielzeug in die USA exportiert wurden. Daher konnte das 
Unternehmen diese wirtschaftlich schwierige Phase gesund überstehen. Der 
Verkauf von einfachen Aluminiumbestecken verringerte sich in den folgenden 
Jahren stetig. Die vorhandenen Produktionsmöglichkeiten in der Aluminium- 
Kokillengießerei sowie seit 1939 im Zink- und Aluminiumdruckguss wurden 
ständig weiter ausgebaut und den Markterfordernissen angepasst. Bis heute 
gehören unter anderem Abwiegeschaufeln in Größen von 3 cm bis 43 cm Länge 
und ein breites Sortiment an Garderobenhaken und Handtuchhaken zum 
Verkaufsprogramm von Wilesco. Die Zink- und Aluminiumdruckgussprodukte 
werden überwiegend als Schaltelemente, Verbindungsstücke usw. in der 
Automobil- und Elektroindustrie eingesetzt. In diesem Verfahren werden auch 
die Schwungräder und Gestänge für die Dampfmaschinen selbst gefertigt. 
Erst ab 1950 wurde mit der Produktion von Modell-Dampfmaschinen und Antriebsmodellen 
begonnen. Neben einigen stationären Maschinen wurde 1966 
die Dampfwalze „Old Smoky“ als mobiles Modell ins Fertigungsprogramm 
aufgenommen. Es folgten neben dem Dampftraktor noch ein Dampffeuerwehrauto, 
angelehnt an ein Original der Fa. MAGIRUS aus dem Jahre 1904. 
Das neueste fahrbare Modell ist der Schlepper „Mighty Atom“. Es handelt 
sich um einen detailgetreuen Nachbau des Originals von 1932. Der Begriff 
”Qualität und Sicherheit” steht nicht nur für Wilesco Dampfmaschinen, sondern 
auch stellvertretend für die gesamte Politik unseres Unternehmens.","global","Standing Committee on Precursors and the CBRN and Explosives security","keine",,,"Standing Committee on Precursors#E03245#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3245#Observer#C",1,0.25,,,"Trade, Business and Industry","http://dvsi.de/",,"01/01/2016","01/12/2016",,"0-9999",0,,,,,,,"Metal"

Since the mid-2000s, numerous European Countries, and the European Union itself, have realized how dependent they have become on foreign imports to access non-energetic raw materials. This dependence has been interpreted as a threat to Europe’s industry and global competitiveness. A list of “Critical Raw Materials” was established in 2010 and revised in 2014 (European Commission MEMO/14/377, 26/05/2014). None of the 20 listed raw materials are significantly mined or produced in Europe. 
It has also been recognized that Europe holds valuable mineral resources in both primary and secondary mines. Concerning the primary mines, Europe has been actively mined over many centuries and many easy-to-access mineral deposits are mostly depleted. The major opportunities to access raw materials within the EU are in populated areas, in low grade or small complex deposits that may vary in composition over time and contain different size of particles from coarse to very fine grains. The challenge in the processing of these raw materials lays on the evolution of the existing processing to the European constraints. For the secondary mines, the challenges are various and the task even more complex. Processes must be adapted or even specifically designed for the material or the waste to be treated. Before being industrially developed, these processes need not only to be efficient but also to take into account the economic, environmental and societal aspects in Europe and abroad.  
Therefore, it is necessary for European industry (mining and metals industry, technology providers, recyclers…) to have access to a network of knowledge that can work cross-sectorially and innovatively by combining the expertise of all members. Flexibility and speed will be enhanced and solutions will come into industrial use faster and more efficiently. Future needs and challenges are not known, but the flexibility and versatility of the network and the cooperation between research partners and stakeholders enable industry to respond to these challenges more efficiently.  
PROMETIA is the research and integration network that has been designed to address these challenges.  
The Association aims to strengthen technical skills and industrial know-how in Europe in raw materials processing for supporting the industrial and economic development by: 
•    promoting an easier access of industrial partners to the most relevant and competent European R&D teams as well as to services & facilities for up-scaling metallurgical and mineral processes in Europe, 
•    promoting the most innovative cutting-edge scientific results from the European research teams towards the industrial partners, 
•    facilitating the visibility and the access of all the partners to different funding opportunities.","European","Raw Materials Initiative

Misją Instytutu Metalurgii Żelaza w Gliwicach jest świadczenie usług naukowo-badawczych, doradczych i szkoleniowych na rzecz producentów stali, użytkowników stali i instytucji publicznych związanych z hutnictwem żelaza i stali. 
 
Działalność naukowo-badawcza Instytutu ma w zdecydowanej większości charakter badań stosowanych, których wyniki są wdrażane lub wykorzystywane w gospodarce. Część badań ma charakter podstawowy (poznawczy) i obejmuje m.in. perspektywiczne kierunki działalności naukowej, rozwojowej i wdrożeniowej Instytutu. kierunki perspektywiczne są ukierunkowane na opracowanie materiałów i technologii innowacyjnych w skali co najmniej krajowej. Badania poznawcze prowadzone są przeważnie jako wyprzedzające w stosunku do zamierzonych prac utylitarnych i pozwalają na wstępne uzyskanie rozeznania, co do celowości podejmowania tematu o znaczeniu praktycznym i szans na jego rozwiązanie. Służą one również rozwojowi naukowemu kadry Instytutu oraz rozwojowi metodyk badawczych stosowanych w Instytucie. 
 
Prace i usługi badawcze wykonywane przez Instytut obejmują następujące obszary: 
■ rozwój i doskonalenie stali i stopów konstrukcyjnych; projektowanie składu chemicznego i struktury wewnętrznej materiału pod kątem uzyskania wymaganych właściwości wyrobu; 
■ rozwój i wdrażanie do produkcji nowych asortymentów oraz doskonalenie jakości już produkowanych półwyrobów i wyrobów hutniczych; 
■ opracowywanie technologii zaawansowanego przetwórstwa i sposobów dostosowania właściwości wyrobów do wymagań odbiorców; 
■ badania procesów technologicznych, w tym badania prowadzone zaawansowanymi metodami symulacji fizycznej i numerycznej; 
■ rozwój i wdrażanie nowych i ulepszonych technologii hutniczych w zakresie: 
– procesów surowcowych, obejmujących produkcję surówki, stali i żelazostopów, 
– procesów ciągłego i konwencjonalnego odlewania stali, 
– procesów kształtowania plastycznego na gorąco wyrobów hutniczych (walcowania wyrobów długich i płaskich, kucia matrycowego i swobodnego), 
– procesów przeróbki plastycznej na zimno, 
– procesów obróbki cieplnej, (w tym obróbki bezpośrednio z ciepła przeróbki plastycznej na gorąco) i procesów wykańczania wyrobów stalowych; 
■ opracowywanie i wdrażanie technologii utylizacji odpadów, oczyszczania ścieków, odpylania gazów odciągowych, recyklingu pyłów i szlamów w zakładach hutniczych; 
■ badanie składu chemicznego, właściwości i struktury materiałów, wykonywanie ekspertyz materiałowych, w tym: badań wyrobów na zgodność z normami oraz analiz wad wyrobów stalowych;  
■ Diagnostyczne badania materiałowe urządzeń energetycznych pracujących w warunkach pełzania w celu dopuszczenia do dalszej eksploatacji.

Since the mid-2000s, numerous European Countries, and the European Union itself, have realized how dependent they have become on foreign imports to access non-energetic raw materials. This dependence has been interpreted as a threat to Europe’s industry and global competitiveness. A list of “Critical Raw Materials” was established in 2010 and revised in 2014 (European Commission MEMO/14/377, 26/05/2014). None of the 20 listed raw materials are significantly mined or produced in Europe. 
It has also been recognized that Europe holds valuable mineral resources in both primary and secondary mines. Concerning the primary mines, Europe has been actively mined over many centuries and many easy-to-access mineral deposits are mostly depleted. The major opportunities to access raw materials within the EU are in populated areas, in low grade or small complex deposits that may vary in composition over time and contain different size of particles from coarse to very fine grains. The challenge in the processing of these raw materials lays on the evolution of the existing processing to the European constraints. For the secondary mines, the challenges are various and the task even more complex. Processes must be adapted or even specifically designed for the material or the waste to be treated. Before being industrially developed, these processes need not only to be efficient but also to take into account the economic, environmental and societal aspects in Europe and abroad.  
Therefore, it is necessary for European industry (mining and metals industry, technology providers, recyclers…) to have access to a network of knowledge that can work cross-sectorially and innovatively by combining the expertise of all members. Flexibility and speed will be enhanced and solutions will come into industrial use faster and more efficiently. Future needs and challenges are not known, but the flexibility and versatility of the network and the cooperation between research partners and stakeholders enable industry to respond to these challenges more efficiently.  
PROMETIA is the research and integration network that has been designed to address these challenges.  
The Association aims to strengthen technical skills and industrial know-how in Europe in raw materials processing for supporting the industrial and economic development by: 
•    promoting an easier access of industrial partners to the most relevant and competent European R&D teams as well as to services & facilities for up-scaling metallurgical and mineral processes in Europe, 
•    promoting the most innovative cutting-edge scientific results from the European research teams towards the industrial partners, 
•    facilitating the visibility and the access of all the partners to different funding opportunities.","European","Raw Materials Initiative

ECRA’s activities are pre-competitive and comprise seminars, workshops and dedicated research projects. Its seminars and workshops provide a platform for teaching the latest knowledge on cement and concrete technology and for communicating and discussing the latest research findings. The seminar programmes cover process and concrete-oriented issues of high concern to the cement industry. Some seminars are of specific interest to cement producers, while others provide information more important to cement associations.   
  
ECRA understands itself as part of a network which comprises various research facilities such as universities, federal institutes and the research centres of cement companies or equipment suppliers. In this context it is able to develop a knowledge centre which benefits from cooperation with the best institutes in the respective areas of research and acts as a core competence centre providing a broad platform for top researchers in each field.","European","1.

To achieve this goal, ChemSec is actively working to: 
  
 
Get a broader acceptance in society for the key principles of Precaution, Substitution, Polluter Pays and Right to Know. 
 
Promote legislation that builds upon these principles, while also helping to ensure that regulations are being effectively followed and enforced. 
 
Encourage business actors to support and apply these principles - by showing that substituting hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives is both scientifically and economically feasible. 
 
Support and build alliances with environmental NGOs to build a strong civil society in order to coordinate the effort to eliminate toxic uses.

We promote open trade and investment 
 
We promote open markets for trade and investment. We place the free flow of goods and services, and the creation of a favourable environment for investment between the EU and Japan at the top of our agenda. 
 
We support the deepening of EU-Japan trade relations through an ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and fair market access that will contribute substantially to industrial growth and job creation. 
 
Beyond bilateral agreements, we foster cooperation between the EU and Japan to realise new multilateral agreements in the World Trade Organisation in order to bring economic advantages to all parties. 
 
We support the timely development of business and strive to remove the administrative hurdles that our member companies face when integrating their European activities, for example when dispatching executives or transferring personal data between the two regions. 
 
2. We encourage a common regulatory framework 
 
Businesses, wherever they are based, need a clear legal and regulatory framework to effectively operate and grow. Instead of a fragmented situation, they need international standards to be able to compete on a level playing field and to contribute to economic growth. 
 
Mutual engagement from the EU and Japan for better regulatory cooperation is crucial to foster sustainable competitiveness and smart innovation in both economies. 
 
We promote the implementation of common regulatory frameworks and international standards in a number of sectors in order to enable Japanese and European companies to operate in a predictable and harmonised regulatory environment. 
 
Our member companies have a long history of pursuing sustainability and are strongly committed to environmental legislation. This is why we stand for increased international cooperation and harmonisation of environmental regulations and standards in key policy areas such as energy efficiency, environmental footprint, and chemical substance management.","A scheme that facilitates sharing information on chemical substances in products, called ""chemSHERPA"" has been developed by the Japanese companies and associations, including us with the support of METI. This scheme is designed to allow companies in a supply chain to transfer information on the composition of a substance, a mixture and simple or complex articles. The system allows provision of information on substances that are subject to regulatory reporting obligation (such as the candidate list in REACH) across the entire supply chain. This may take place through a request to a supplying company from a recipient company or through a company’s own initiative to market its materials/components/articles across supply chains. 
The technical system is based on a standardized XML-format and is developed in close collaboration with experts involved in the international standard IEC624741, which is of primary relevance in the electronics industry. So far chemSHERPA is available in English, Japanese and Chinese. The intention is to make the tool universally applicable to all industry sectors (contacts with the car industry in Japan have been established already) and usable on a global scale.",,,"Competent Authorities for Biocidal Products (Regulation (EU) No 528/2012)#E03125#http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3125#Observer#C",2,0.75,,,"Trade, Business and Industry, Environment, Research and innovation, Public Health, Food Safety","JCIA is a member of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA).","Our members companies list;

Within this framework, the Association's main purpose is to serve the Members and the European chemical industry by generating and aggregating scientific knowledge that fosters the purpose of the Association in critical areas and by offering needs-oriented services and expertise to its Members in, amongst others, regulatory, scientific and technical matters. In view of supporting this main purpose, the Association may, in compliance with the antitrust law, promote, defend and represent with particular emphasis on their scientific, technical, pedagogic, environmental, economic, statistical, legal and structural aspects, all matters of common interest to the European chemical industry, in the widest sense, at European and global level, always endeavouring to add value as a collective compared to individual Member's activities.  
 
In order to realize the aforementioned purpose of international utility, the Association may in particular develop the following activities: 
 
a) To build a solid scientific knowledge base on chemistry and chemicals in Europe as required to deliver on the vision and foster the purpose of the Association;  
 
b) To bring together industry stakeholders in order to exchange information, to develop new understandings, science and knowledge and to foster or facilitate collaborative innovation; 
 
c) To bring together the competences of Members to deliver on the vision and foster the purpose of the Association;  
 
d) To be instrumental in building consensus among Members and between Members and other stakeholders, always complying with antitrust rules and applicable regulations and striving to reach the highest target;    
 
e) To endeavour to create business friendly, science based and positive framework conditions to foster innovation in Europe and strive for a world class European investment environment for safe, innovative and resource efficient chemical products and processes; 
 
f) To serve as a resource and forum for education, information sharing and networking between the Members;  
 
g) To contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to drive forward resource efficiency and sustainability in the chemical industry and the activities of the Association; 
 
h) To constantly expand and promote Responsible Care; 
 
i) To secure the ""license to grow"" for chemicals companies in Europe, beyond the ""license to operate""; 
 
j) To strive to engage in and shape societal debates in key and focus areas, especially on issues related to risk and new technologies; 
 
k) To inspire the young generations and promote the benefits of chemistry and STEM skills (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); 
 
l) To be the voice of the European Chemical Industry at European and global level by representing the interests of the Members of the Association across Europe and advocating their interests to create the right support and policy frameworks for the chemical industry in Europe and beyond, addressing specifically European policy makers, the European Union institutions and other European regulatory bodies; 
 
m) To maximise efforts to build the reputation of the chemical industry.  
 
Our members embody the different sectors and sub-sectors of the chemical industries which study all questions of specific interests (see list on Cefic website www.cefic.org)","European, global","Here the main different EU policies followed by Cefic:

Cefic follows as well a series of policies, legislation o regulatory acts related to some specific sub-sector(s) of the European chemical industry. Those activities are organised within Cefic via the Cefic Sector Groups, which are dealing with specific substances/products or families of substances/products. There are currently around 70 Cefic Sector groups.  
 
The activities of all the Cefic Sector Groups carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the formulation or implementation of policy and the decision-making processes of the EU institutions are covered by the registration of Cefic into the EU Transparency Register.

The Plastic Soup Foundation wants to put an end to the increasing pollution of the seas and oceans with plastics. We want to prevent even more plastics entering the sea in the future. So: 
 
Be aware:  
The Plastic Soup Foundation constantly draws attention to plastic soup through campaigns, news articles and social media. 
 
Get educated:  
Anyone who wants to find out more about plastic soup is in the right place when they come to us. For instance in 2016 Plastic Soup Foundation developed educational programs for primary schools and secondary schools. In addition we work together with experts, politicians, organizations, universities and companies which have similar missions or visions. 
 
Find solutions: 
The Plastic Soup Foundation stimulates all possible (innovative) solutions which help tackle the causes of plastic soup at source. Measures which prevent plastic entering the environment, water and eventually ending up in the sea have the greatest impact in our opinion. This includes reducing the amount of single-use consumer plastics, the development of a Plastic Footprint for companies as well as smart devices which collect plastic in waterways.","global","EU Plastic Strategy/Circular Economy

Innovation is the engine that drives the transition towards a circular economy for plastics - a New Plastics Economy.  A key driver of economic growth, innovation is required to fill the multiple technology, design and business model gaps in the current plastic value chain as it transitions into a system that works. Discussions with a broad range of industry stakeholders and participants in the Ellen MacArthur’s New Plastics Economy initiative have identified innovation priorities in all segments of the plastics value chain for packaging.  
 
Other vertical markets with sizeable plastic footprint are Agriculture, Healthcare, Transportation and Construction. Each of these markets has indicated an interest in transitioning towards a circular economy, which in turn drives their own need for innovation in their own priority areas. 
Meeting the needs of these markets requires a robust, thriving innovation eco-system with hundreds, then thousands of early stage innovators who compete, grow and outperform each other, gradually increasing in quality, breadth and value. Developing and growing a robust innovation eco-system has multiple benefits: 
•    Accelerate the pace of discovery and innovation in priority areas of the New Plastics Economy; 
•    De-risk corporate investment in R&D, innovation and prototyping;  
•    Support the development of commercially viable prototypes meeting industry specifications; and 
•    Support and strengthen the innovation engine, securing the future pipeline; 
 
The innovation eco-system for plastics has three key stakeholders who exist in a synergistic relationship: innovators, industry and investors. Their interdependency is mutually reinforcing, but each of them have unique needs and challenges.  
To meet these needs, Think Beyond Plastic is operating an Innovation Center for the New Plastics Economy which supports the needs of three key stakeholders: innovators, investors and industry.  
 
The Innovation Center is cultivating a robust innovation pipeline for all areas of the circular economy for plastics. Towards this goal, it is focused on growing and strengthening the innovation eco-system specifically by meeting the needs of innovators, investors and industry. Its structure incorporates an Innovation Hub and Regional User Facilities.  
 
The Innovation Hub has dedicated portals for innovators, industry and investors. The network of Regional User Facilities was launched in 2018 with a flagship center in partnership with California State University. Planned expansion for 2019+ includes geographies with strategic relevance to the circular economy for plastics.  
 
Currently, the Innovation Hub identifies and assesses 200+ early stage innovations, leveraging its global network of partners and institutions, and innovation challenges. It trains up to 30 startups and produces an annual Innovation Showcase and Investor Forum. The Regional User Facilities will substantially expand these capacities with wider access to innovation and support for qualified innovators.  
 
The Regional User Facilities offer access to equipment for testing, experimentation, prototyping and scalability, MVP development, design and packaging. Some facilities (opening in 2019) will offer special areas of expertise – i.e. cellulose, biomaterials, green chemistry etc. The network has a planned expansion in SE Asia, GCC, South America and two locations in Europe. The expansion of the network will provide essential support to the raising wave of global innovators and will substantially increase the flow of regional innovation.","global","EU Plastics Initiative, Marine plastics and Waste management

The newly formed company has a viable and proven solution to the global problem of plastic waste pollution by transforming waste destined for landfill – globally, more than £240 billion worth a year – or the ocean, estimated to be eight million tonnes a year, into hydrocarbon products and back to plastic through chemical recycling. The industrial plants can produce up to 19,000 litres of hydrocarbon products from 20 tonnes of plastic feedstock. Real end of life plastics (ELP) from domestic wastes are recycled rather than treating “industrial plastics”, which are typically of one type and relatively clean. Unlike many companies working on similar solutions, who are either in the laboratory, at pilot plant stage or processing limited quantities of narrowly selected clean post-industrial plastics, Plastic Energy’s UK based team of technology specialists have more than 10 years’ experience developing the unique, patented thermal anaerobic technology (TAC) chemical recycling process. TAC does not use catalysts which are often expensive, easily poisoned and hazardous to dispose. Instead, Plastic Energy’s TAC Plants are uniquely controlled using non-contaminated thermal degradation, agitation and carbon chain length selectivity to produce a variety of outputs. Through its practices, Plastic Energy is a champion of the circular economy, rescuing plastic waste -originally produced from crude oil drilled from the earth - from landfill and transforming it through chemical recycling into hydrocarbon fuels, oils and back into plastic. Our aim is to apply our expertise across the world to establish industrial plants producing products relevant to our business partners as well as helping to tackle pollution and stimulate local economies. 
 
Fields of interest: Plastic Energy’s mission is to be the world leading, sustainable and profitable producer of synthetic second-generation fuels and feedstocks for new plastics from end-of-life plastic. The company has plans to expand further in Europe, the USA, Asia, as well as South America and the Caribbean.","European, global, national","- RED / Renewable Energy Directive

This was the first time such fuel had been used in an aircraft and Jeremy in his Vans aircraft RV9a proved that end of life plastic can be transformed from a pollutant in a viable alternative jet A1 fuel. Jeremy's flight and preparation and the role of Plastic Energy in his success received global coverage. The United Nations Environment communications unit interviewed Jeremy for their newsletter and he as able to talk about the nature and importance of Plastic Energy's role in his success. Plastic Energy features in the award-winning film ‘A Plastic Ocean’ as an example of one of the solutions to the global problem of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans. Dubbed ""the most important film of our time"" by Sir David Attenborough the film shows the devastating impact of plastic pollution in the world's oceans. The film has received more than 500 screenings across the world and has been released on Netflix and Amazon.
