During the [REINVENT](http://www.reinvent-project.eu) project various studies have been done, looking either at broader transition narratives and specific innovations. On this page I zoom out of the material for a bit, to provide an overview of all the things that have been looked at.

## REINVENT as EU project

[REINVENT](http://www.reinvent-project.eu) is a European Union funded research project. It's part of the H2020 Environment and Resources programme, which is a relative small one compared to some other EU funded programmes. Of the 6737 projects listed in the [EASME DB](https://sc5.easme-web.eu/), only 379 have some connection to the [REINVENT](http://www.reinvent-project.eu) themes (basic manufacturing, transitions, industry). Interestingly from my analysis of the [EASME DB](https://sc5.easme-web.eu/), the majority of the projects with an manufacturing industry connection are dedicated to food related themes. Second runner up is the chemical/plastics theme. Of these, it are mostly SME's who get projects funded (via the EIT SME fund),  although most euro's go to assumingly Engineering/R&D projects in the H2020 Advanced Materials Manufacturing Processing and Biotechnology.

## Roadmaps and scenario studies
In our first [deliverable (D4.1)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59f0cb986957da5faf64971e/t/5a968cd7652deaeda0a2a62a/1519815901936/D4.1+Existing+visions+and+scenarios.pdf) we took stock of the available forward looking literature on industry decarbonization. I have also quickly scraped together some of the data processing work that I had done for this report [(see the other github page here)](https://marieyesse.github.io/IAM_dashboard.html). We have been so busy with scraping the docs that it never came to me to take a step back and look at it from a more meta perspective. Well. Here we are now! In belows figures I categorize the analysed corpus to (1) industry and (2) field of publishing. The timeline is also supplemented with new publications released after completing our deliverable (>2016)

```{r roadmaps, results=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=11, fig.height=9, fig.cap="_**Figure**: Timeline of published roadmaps and scenario studies on industry decarbonization per industry"}

```

Of course there can be some bias in the selection and I have not been super strict in my "hauls" of new literature either (not all are model-based scenarios for example, not all are EU-focused, not all are looking at a 2050 objective, etc). Nonetheless, the overview remains interesting.

```

Analysing the meta-data of studies, it's the first step up towards full qualitative Corpus analysis. I learned that extracting all text of all multi-k worded reports is pushing my system to its limits, so I am just going to put the image to the outcome of my word network analysis here. One take-away here is that most sectors appear to apply their own language in most cases - with only a few overlapping semantics (limited to europe, technology, carbon, emissions, etc). Surprising? No, perhaps not, but interesting nonetheless.

## Innovations studied

The REINVENT project also looked at various social and technological innovations from a more social science perspective. The dataset is quite extensive and I found myself rather overwhelmed by all the information coming at me that was not easily structured.  As I needed a practice dataset for a new R skill, I fiddled around with this dataset to create the following overview. What I figured out by doing so is that our Innovations database had quite a large portion of technology-oriented innovations. Surprised? No, perhaps not, but I somehow expected a bigger focus on social innovations! (which seems only the case in the Meat/Dairy sector)
