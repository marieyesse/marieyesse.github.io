<h1>Trade Associations et al</h1>
<p>Having been involved in the <a href="https://www.reinvent-project.eu">REINVENT project</a> since 2017, I have had the opportunity to deep-dive into the transition patterns of 5 basic industry sectors (Steel, Plastics, Pulp &amp; Paper and Meat and Dairy). To figure out what else is involved with these few themes, I have started looking into which organizations are keeping themselves busy with these themes. I draw information on EU lobby groups from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/search.do?locale=en&amp;reset=">EU Transparancy Register</a>, which is a voluntary and open source database to which all active in EU lobby can register.</p>

<strong>Figure</strong>: How many organizations exist per material?
</p>
</div>
<p>The Steel and Chemical basic materials appear to be most represented in EU lobby. In a similar fashion I spot that Trade Associations are mostly involved in EU activity, followed by companies with most notably in the Chemical and Steel sector, while the engagement of NGO’s appears to be more sector specific (Chemicals and Steel to some degree). Consultancies appear to be solely involved with the Cement sector (Cementis).</p>

<strong>Figure</strong>: Estimated number of employees per organization working on EU lobby activities
</p>
</div>
In a similar fashion we can plot the influence per organization in estimated expenditures spend on EU lobby. However, to compare oranges to oranges I normalize the expenditures on EU activity by dividing the reported expenditures with the number of FTE available for EU activity, as to get the an indication on the budget per head active in EU activity. By doing so I find that the influence of the chemical sector is overrun by the Steel sector, with Cement in close pursuit showing a significant relative increase of influence as compared to the size of physical presence.

<h2>Fields of interest</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/search.do?locale=en&amp;reset=">EU Transparancy Register</a> also allows to register the organizations’ field of interest. We can see some strong links to topics like climate, public, industry, food, environment. Weaker links are found for topics like security, safety, and a couple more. The picture has a rather star-like shape, implying that the basic material sectors mostly share similar interests.</p>

<p>In order to check out the (daily) talking points of several of these organizations, I selected a couple of specific basic material trade organizations and the top tiers deducted from the abovementioned figures. As such I have identified <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EUROFER_eu">EUROFER_eu</a> (Steel), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CEMBUREAU">CEMBUREAU</a> (Cement), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CEFIC">CEFIC</a> (Chemicals), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/PlasticsEurope">PlasticsEurope</a> (Plastics), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CEPI_Paper">CEPI_Paper</a> (paper), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EDA_Dairy">EDA_Dairy</a> (Dairy) and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/FIL_IDF">FIL_IDF</a> (Milk) as interesting to have a closer look at.</p>

<p>All of the organizations, except for the EDF_Dairy appear to be active on twitter. The week-long twitter activity shows that PlasticsEurope has been very active, mostly due to a conference. This also shows in the figure below, (showing #identiplast2019 to be the most used word). Other sectors have peaked also around March 8th, implyinga sharpening of communicative activity around special events.</p>

<p>Despite some distortion in the number of times a word has prompted (which depends on how active an organization is on twitter), we can see that the Plastics industry makes the terms “recycling” and “waste” fly, the Cement sector is more eager to take up the words “opportunities” and their own products in tweets. The paper sector interestingly is the sole industry discussing “decarbonisation” in their communication.</p>

<h2>Are there sector-specific or shared topics?</h2>
<p>One week of Twitter Activity can be considered a snapshot of the communications coming from the organizations. To correct for this bias, I can also look at the reoccuring words over longer timelines (drawing out 2000 of the organizations’ tweets, covering (roughly) the period 2016-2018). In the next figure I show which words are most commonly used by the organizations and whether they are interconnected with other sectors.</p>

<strong>Figure</strong>: Are certain topics sector-specific or are they also shared?
</p>
</div>
<p>The figure shows that the Steel and Dairy sector have rather specific vocubulary, which can be seen from their more distant position in the picture. Other sector, while having their own vocabulary too, share more common talking points. Most commonly cross-sectoral talking points show to be all related to refering to the EU. Interestingly, the Paper and Steel sector cover more ‘circular’ topics, “energy” and “climate” are more a Chemical and Paper discussion point, while “CO2” is shared more by Steel and Cement. The links in all cases are rather weak though.</p>
