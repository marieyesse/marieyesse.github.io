![](img/profile.jpg)            | Welcome to the webpage of MariÃ«sse van Sluisveld ("Marie-yes-se""), PhD, scientific employee at PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency researching potential decarbonisation pathways for various long-term futures. As I am using an Integrated Assessment Model [IMAGE_PBL](http://www.twitter.com/IMAGE_PBL), producing a lot of data, I will mostly present on this page my research findings in a dynamic plotting style.
