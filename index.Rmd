![](img/profile.jpg)            | Welcome to the webpage of MariÃ«sse (_"Marie-yes-se"_) van Sluisveld (PhD). I am a scientific employee at PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency,  using and producing data on a daily base to advise and support decision making on long-term systemic change. My little corner of creation will mostly function as archive of achievement and wrapper for various short reads, data showcasings and code storage.
